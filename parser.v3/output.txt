title: Statistical thermodynamics of membrane bending mediated protein-protein
  attraction
published: 2000-01-01
summary:   Integral membrane proteins deform the surrounding bilayer creating
long-ranged forces that influence distant proteins. These forces can be
attractive or repulsive, depending on the proteins' shape, height, contact
angle with the bilayer, as well as the local membrane curvature. Although
interaction energies are not pairwise additive, for sufficiently low protein
density, thermodynamic properties depend only upon pair interactions. Here, we
compute pair interaction potentials and entropic contributions to the
two-dimensional osmotic pressure of a collection of noncircular proteins. In
contrast to direct short-ranged interactions such as van der Waal's,
hydrophobic, or electrostatic interactions, both local membrane Gaussian
curvature and protein ellipticity can induce attractions between two proteins
at distances of up to ten times their typical radii. For flat membranes,
bending rigidities of $\sim 30k_{B}T$, and moderate ellipticities, we find
thermally averaged attractive interactions of order $\sim 2k_{B}T$. These
interactions may play an important role in the intermediate stages of protein
aggregation.

title: Strong Coupling Approach to the Supersymmetric Kondo Model
published: 2000-07-07
summary:   We carry out the strong coupling expansion for the SU(N) Kondo model where
the impurity spin is represented by a L-shaped Young tableau. Using second
order perturbation theory around the strong coupling fixed point it is shown
that when the antisymmetric component of the Young-tableau contains more than
N/2 entries, the strong-coupling fixed point becomes unstable to a two-stage
Kondo effect. By comparing the strong coupling results obtained here with the
result using a supersymmetric large N expansion, we are also able to confirm
the validity of the the supersymmetric formalism for mixed symmetry Kondo
models.

title: Luttinger Liquid Physics in the Superconductor Vortex Core
published: 2000-05-26
summary:   We study several aspects of the structure of vortices in conventional s-wave
Type $II$ superconductors. It is well-known that there are low energy
quasiparticles bound to the core of a vortex. We show that under certain
conditions, these quasiparticles form a degenerate Fermi gas with a finite
density of states at the Fermi energy. In three dimensional superconductors,
the result is a one dimensional Fermi gas of quasiparticles bound to the core
of a vortex line. As is usual in one dimensional systems, interactions between
the quasiparticles lead to Luttinger liquid behaviour. This may be probed
through STM tunneling into the vortex core. We further suggest that a novel
Peierls-type instability in the shape of the vortex line may develop due to
interactions between the quasiparticle gas and fluctuations in the vortex line
shape.

title: Characterization of ferrimagnetic Heisenberg chains according to the
  constituent spins
published: 2000-01-01
summary:   The low-energy structure and the thermodynamic properties of ferrimagnetic
Heisenberg chains of alternating spins $S$ and $s$ are investigated by the use
of numerical tools as well as the spin-wave theory. The elementary excitations
are calculated through an efficient quantum Monte Carlo technique featuring
imaginary-time correlation functions and are characterized in terms of
interacting spin waves. The thermal behavior is analyzed with particular
emphasis on its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dual aspect. The extensive
numerical and analytic calculations lead to the classification of the
one-dimensional ferrimagnetic behavior according to the constituent spins: the
ferromagnetic ($S>2s$), antiferromagnetic ($S<2s$), and balanced ($S=2s$)
ferrimagnetism.

title: Linear and nonlinear rheology of wormlike micelles
published: 2000-01-02
summary:   Several surfactant molecules self-assemble in solution to form long,
cylindrical, flexible wormlike micelles. These micelles can be entangled with
each other leading to viscoelastic phases. The rheological properties of such
phases are very interesting and have been the subject of a large number of
experimental and theoretical studies in recent years. We shall report on our
recent work on the macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow behaviour of
dilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium
Tosilate). This system forms elongated micelles and exhibits strong
viscoelasticity at low concentrations ($\sim$ 0.9 wt%) without the addition of
electrolytes. Microrheology measurements of $G(\omega)$ have been done using
diffusing wave spectroscopy which will be compared with the conventional
frequency sweep measurements done using a cone and plate rheometer. The second
part of the paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the measured shear
stress $\sigma$ is a nonmonotonic function of the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$. In
stress-controlled experiments, the shear stress shows a plateau for
$\dot{\gamma}$ larger than some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier
reports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates et al have proposed that the plateau is a
signature of mechanical instability in the form of shear bands. We have carried
out extensive experiments under controlled strain rate conditions, to study the
time-dependence of shear stress. The measured time series of shear stress has
been analysed in terms of correlation integrals and Lyapunov exponents to show
unambiguously that the behaviour is typical of low dimensional dynamical
systems.

title: Correlations in doped Antiferromagnets
published: 2000-01-02
summary:   A comprehensive study of doped RVB states is performed. It reveals a
fundamental connection between superconductivity and quantum spin fluctuations
in underdoped cuprates :
 {\em Cooper pair hopping} strongly reduces the local magnetization $m_0$. This
effect pertains to recent muon spin rotation measurements in which $m_0$ varies
weakly with hole doping in the poorly conducting regime, but drops
precipitously above the onset of superconductivity. Gutzwiller mean field
Approximation (GA) is found to agree with numerical Monte Carlo calculation. GA
shows for example that for a bond amplitude $u(r)=e^{-r/\xi}$, spin spin
correlations decay exponentially with a correlation length $\propto e^{3\pi
\xi^2/2}$. Expectation value of the Heisenberg model is found to be correlated
with average loop density.

title: Extension of the Brinkman-Rice picture and the Mott transition
published: 2001-01-22
summary:   In order to explain the metal-Mott-insulator transition, the Brinkman-Rice
(BR) picture is extended. In the case of less than one as well as one electron
per atom, the on-site Coulomb repulsion is given by U={kappa}{rho}^2U_c by
averaging the electron charge per atom over all atomic sites, where {kappa} is
the correlation strength of U, {rho} is the band filling factor, and U_c is the
critical on-site Coulomb energy. The effective mass of a quasiparticle is found
to be m*/m=1/{1-{kappa}^2{rho}^4} for 0<{kappa}{rho}^2<1 and seems to follow
the heat capacity data of Sr_{1-x}La_xTiO_3 and YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-delta} at
{kappa}=1 and 0<{kappa}{rho}^2<1. The Mott transition of the first order occurs
at {kappa}{rho}^2=1 and a band-type metal-insulator transition takes place at
{kappa}{rho}^2=0. This Mott transition is compared with that in the d=infinity
Hubbard model. The effective mass for 2D-DOS instead of the vHs can be used for
the mechanism of high T_c superconductivity.

title: History dependence of peak effect in CeRu$_2$ and V$_3$Si: an analogy
  with the random field Ising systems
published: 2000-01-03
summary:   We present results of transport measurements showing distinct path dependence
of the electrical resistance in the superconducting vortex state of single
crystal samples of CeRu$_2$ and V$_3$Si. Resistance measured in the vortex
state of both the systems prepared by field cooling (FC), indicates a
relatively higher degree of disorder than when it is prepared by isothermal
variation of field. Small oscillations of magnetic field modify the resistance
in the FC state, highlighting the metastable nature of that state. An analogy
is drawn with the FC state of the random-field Ising systems.

summary:   We study chaos in the Hamiltonian Mean Field model (HMF), a system with many
degrees of freedom in which $N$ classical rotators are fully coupled. We review
the most important results on the dynamics and the thermodynamics of the HMF,
and in particular we focus on the chaotic properties.We study the Lyapunov
exponents and the Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy, namely their dependence on the
number of degrees of freedom and on energy density, both for the ferromagnetic
and the antiferromagnetic case.

title: Spin-Dependent Josephson Current through Double Quantum Dots and
  Measurement of Entangled Electron States
published: 2000-09-05
summary:   We study a double quantum dot each dot of which is tunnel-coupled to
superconducting leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime, a spin-dependent
Josephson coupling between two superconductors is induced, as well as an
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange coupling between the spins on the double
dot which can be tuned by the superconducting phase difference. We show that
the correlated spin states-singlet or triplets-on the double dot can be probed
via the Josephson current in a dc-SQUID setup.
